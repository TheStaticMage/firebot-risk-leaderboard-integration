# Upgrading

## Versioning

- A **patch release** changes the last number (e.g. `0.0.3` -> `0.0.4`). These releases may fix bugs or add features, but your existing setup should continue to work just fine.
- A **minor release** changes the middle number (e.g. `0.0.4` -> `0.1.0`). These releases typically make considerable changes but are generally backward-compatible. Your existing setup should continue to work.
- A **major release** changes the first number (e.g. `0.1.5` -> `1.0.0`). These releases correspond to a major milestone and may contain breaking changes.
